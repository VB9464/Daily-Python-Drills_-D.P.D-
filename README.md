# 🐍 Python Coding Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Python Coding Practice** repo! 🚀  
This is my collection of Python programs, starting from **beginner basics** to **data structures, algorithms, and machine learning**.

---

## 🔹 Beginner Programs

**➡️ Contains simple Python programs to get started.**

🔹Basics (Hello World, variables, input/output)
🔹Loops & conditionals
🔹Simple math & string problems
🔹Small exercises to strengthen fundamentals  

---

## 🔹 Intermediate Programs
**➡️ Covers slightly complex programs and small projects.**

🔹Games (Guess the Number, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe)
🔹File handling (To-do app, Library system)
🔹Simple simulators (Dice roller, Banking system)
🔹Strengthens problem-solving & project building skills 

---

## 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms
**➡️ Focused on Data Structures & Algorithms in Python.**

🔹Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
🔹Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary)
🔹Stack, Queue, Linked List implementations
🔹Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables
🔹Classic DSA problems useful for coding interviews
